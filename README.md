# Loan_Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict loan approvals based on applicant data. The model evaluates various factors such as income, credit history, and loan amount to determine approval chances.

Dataset

The dataset contains applicant details, including:

Gender

Marital Status

Dependents

Education Level

Self-Employment Status

Applicant and Co-applicant Income

Loan Amount & Term

Credit History

Property Area

Loan Approval Status (Target variable)

Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key insights and correlations.

Feature Engineering: Transforming data to enhance model performance.

Model Selection & Training: Comparing machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

Model Evaluation: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

Predictions & Insights: Interpreting results for better loan approval strategies.

How to Run

Install dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Open and run Loan_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Results & Conclusion

The project identifies key factors influencing loan approvals and builds an accurate predictive model. Further improvements can be made by using deep learning models or advanced feature engineering techniques.
